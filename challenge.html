    "During this pandemic we have all learned just how important social
    distancing is. However it is difficult to practice social distancing in some
    situations, one being public transportaion. This has led to a lot of people
    to just stop using public transportation all together due to the fear of
    getting COVID-19 which means the MTA has lost a large amount of money.
    However some people have no choice but to continue taking public
    transportation despite this. The MTA has tried to ease some of these
    concerns by putting up a plasic spread towards the front of the bus to
    seperate the elderly from evertone else, but honestly this is not enough
    because the people in back are still bundled up together. Now the challenge
    of this is increasing the safety measures for passengers who regurly use
    public transportion by using technology. "
